# table definition for 2007 through 2009 HPMS data

Really Caltrans should keep dumping data in this format, as it matches
the format in the hpms documentation, but in fact they've decided to
dump as shape files with just a tiny number of columns that we
explicitly ask for.

Includes code for hpms old data table, called hpms.hpms

requires hpms schema sqitch package is already deployed.
